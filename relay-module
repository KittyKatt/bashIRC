The relay module is currently in beta stage.
To use: 
1. Move relay.module from contrib/ to modules/
2. In bin/, ./relay "<channel>" "<corresponding input file>"

* And no, I will not tell you what does corresponding input file means, figure it out your own.

- More documentation to come when it's fully ready :)
